# Getting started with dc43

Pick the guide that matches your role and the environment you have access to. Each walkthrough links back to component reference
material when you want to dive deeper.

## Scenario index

- [Operations: publish shared service backends](ops-service-backend.md)
- [Spark developers: run dc43 fully locally](spark-local.md)
- [Spark developers: consume shared dc43 services](spark-remote.md)
- [Spark developers: generate pipeline stubs with the contracts app](spark-contract-app-helper.md)
- [Databricks teams: integrate dc43 with Unity Catalog](databricks.md)

The guides assume you have a working Python 3.11 environment. When you work from a source checkout run `pip install -e .` from the
repository root so editable installs pick up sibling packages.
