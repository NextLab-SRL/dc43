# Getting started with dc43

Pick the guide that matches your role and the environment you have access to. Each walkthrough links back to component reference
material when you want to dive deeper.

## Scenario index

- [Operations: publish shared service backends](ops-service-backend.md)
- [Spark developers: run dc43 fully locally](spark-local.md)
- [Spark developers: consume shared dc43 services](spark-remote.md)
- [Spark developers: generate pipeline stubs with the contracts app](spark-contract-app-helper.md)
- [Contracts app: automate the setup wizard with Playwright scenarios](../tutorials/contracts-setup-automation.md)
- [Databricks teams: integrate dc43 with Unity Catalog](databricks.md)

The guides assume you have a working Python 3.11 environment. When you work from a source checkout run `pip install -e .` from the
repository root so editable installs pick up sibling packages.

## Documentation assistant

The dc43 app can expose a docs-first chat experience using LangChain and Gradio. Install the optional
dependencies and enable the feature in your configuration:

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -e ".[demo]"

# Already installed the demo extras? you do not need a second
# `dc43-contracts-app[docs-chat]` install – the meta package pulls the
# assistant dependencies automatically.

export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key"

cat <<'TOML' > ~/dc43/contracts-app.toml
[docs_chat]
enabled = true
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-4o-mini"
embedding_model = "text-embedding-3-small"
api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
TOML

# Make the config visible to the demo launcher (export once per shell or load it
# via your preferred `.env` tooling).
export DC43_CONTRACTS_APP_CONFIG="$HOME/dc43/contracts-app.toml"

# `api_key_env` stores the *name* of the environment variable that contains your
# secret. Populate it separately, e.g. with `direnv`, `dotenv`, or a manual
# `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...` before starting the app.

# Launch the demo. The runner copies your docs_chat overrides into its generated
# configuration so the workspace/backend defaults stay intact.
dc43-demo
```

Mount the config via `DC43_CONTRACTS_APP_CONFIG` or copy the snippet into your existing TOML file.
Restart the application and open `/docs-chat` to chat with the Markdown guides bundled in `docs/`.

> ℹ️ Prefer a one-liner? Use `DC43_CONTRACTS_APP_CONFIG=$HOME/dc43/contracts-app.toml dc43-demo`
> (without chaining via `&&`). The shell must export the variable for the launcher to
> see it—otherwise the docs assistant falls back to the disabled defaults and reminds
> you to enable `[docs_chat]`.

> ⚠️ pip treats `pip install --no-cache-dir -e ".[demo]"` and a follow-up
> `pip install "dc43-contracts-app[docs-chat]"` as competing requirements when
> they point at the same checkout. Pick the single command that matches your
> environment to avoid the resolution error shown above.

Prefer a guided experience? The contracts setup wizard now includes a **Documentation assistant**
module under the *User experience* group. Selecting the Gradio assistant option captures the same
`[docs_chat]` settings (provider, models, key environment variable, and optional path overrides) so
the exported bundle and configuration downloads are ready to deploy without manual edits.
