# Spark developers: generate stubs with the contracts app helper

The contracts app ships a visual "integration helper" that turns approved contracts into starter code for your pipelines. Follow
these steps to run the helper locally or against the shared governance service.

## 1. Install the contracts app

The helper lives in the `dc43-contracts-app` package. Install it alongside the Spark extras so generated snippets match the APIs
you use in notebooks:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "dc43-contracts-app[spark]"
```

If you work from this repository run `pip install -e .[demo]` to install the demo dependencies and reuse editable sources.

## 2. Point the app at a backend

Choose one of the following configurations:

- **Use the shared service** – set the backend URL and token you received from the operations team:

  ```bash
  export DC43_CONTRACTS_APP_BACKEND_MODE="remote"
  export DC43_CONTRACTS_APP_BACKEND_URL="https://governance.example.com"
  export DC43_BACKEND_TOKEN="super-secret"
  ```

- **Run everything locally** – leave the defaults in place and the helper will spawn the embedded backend with an in-memory
  contract store. Populate it with sample contracts under `~/.config/dc43/contracts_app/contracts/` or point
  `DC43_CONTRACT_STORE` to an existing repository of ODCS documents.

## 3. Start the UI

You can run the helper directly from your virtual environment or rely on a
container published by the operations team.

### Option A – run from source

Launch the FastAPI app with Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn dc43_contracts_app.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/integration-helper` in your browser. The landing
page shows your available datasets on the left and the integration helper on the
right.

### Option B – run from a container

If your platform team published the contracts app image, pull it and point the
container at the governance backend:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e DC43_CONTRACTS_APP_BACKEND_URL="https://governance.example.com" \
  -e DC43_BACKEND_TOKEN="super-secret" \
  myregistry.azurecr.io/dc43/contracts-app:latest
```

Override `DC43_CONTRACTS_APP_BACKEND_MODE=embedded` and mount `/contracts` if
you need the container to spawn the backend locally.

## 4. Generate a Spark stub

1. Select one or more contracts from the catalog tree.
2. For each transformation, choose the integration strategy (Spark batch, Delta Live Tables, streaming, ...).
3. Click **Generate stub**. The helper calls `/api/integration-helper/stub` to assemble a tailored Spark snippet.
4. Copy the highlighted code block and paste it into your notebook or repo. The snippet already imports
   `write_with_contract`, sets up the expected contract version, and includes TODO markers for business-specific logic.

You can switch the target language from the dropdown above the stub (for example to Python or SQL) and regenerate as often as
needed.

## 5. Keep everything in sync

- Refresh the page after the governance team publishes a new contract version so the helper pulls the latest schema.
- Re-run the helper whenever you change integration strategies—the generator adapts to streaming vs. batch choices.
- Pair this walkthrough with the [remote Spark guide](spark-remote.md) so the generated stub points at the correct backend.
