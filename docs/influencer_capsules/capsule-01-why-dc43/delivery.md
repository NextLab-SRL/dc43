# Delivery Guide – Capsule 01

## Tone & Energy
- Start with urgency: speak 10% faster than your normal cadence for the hook,
  then settle into a confident, advisory rhythm.
- Smile on the CTA slide to reinforce momentum.
- Use your hands to illustrate modularity—stacking motions when referencing
  building blocks.

## Camera & Framing
- Shoot in 4K 24fps, center crop at 3:2 for short-form exports.
- Alternate between medium shots (waist up) and quick punch-ins during stats.
- Add a subtle teal-and-orange LUT to match the DC43 palette.

## Teleprompter Rhythm
- Load the narration from `script.md` into a teleprompter app with 170 wpm.
- Insert beat markers at every {Action: …} cue for editor alignment.
- Pause 0.5 seconds before numbers to let overlays animate.

## CTA Reminders
- Verbally mention the quickstart URL and the Thursday stand-up—both appear on
  the final slide.
- Encourage viewers to comment their blockers; call-to-action should feel like an
  invitation to co-create.

## Post Production Notes
- Layer subtle synth bed at -20 LUFS, duck under narration.
- Animate the modular blocks slide using simple scale-in and glow effects.
- Add subtitles in brand colors (#F5F7FA text on semi-transparent #0B1533 bar).
