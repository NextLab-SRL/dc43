# Capsule 01 – Why DC43 Matters Now

**Runtime target:** 3 minutes 15 seconds (LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok)

## Segment 1 – Hook (0:00–0:25)
- **Narration**
  > "If your data contracts still live in spreadsheets and endless meetings, you're burning weeks of delivery time. Let me show you how DC43 turns that chaos into click-to-launch governance."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Start on a tight shot, snap fingers at "click-to-launch" to trigger an animated cut from messy spreadsheets to a clean DC43 diagram.}
  - {Action: Display lower-third banner "DC43 = Modular Data Contracts" with fast swipe-in.}

## Segment 2 – Pain Today (0:25–1:05)
- **Narration**
  > "Most teams tie their contracts to a single platform. Warehouse team changes schema? Suddenly marketing dashboards break, ML features go stale, and security teams scramble for new approvals. Meanwhile auditors are asking why there isn't a unified trail of who changed what." 
  > "That fragility is why 63% of governance leaders told us they feel like they're constantly playing catch-up."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Cut to B-roll carousel of broken dashboards, incident Slack messages, and compliance emails.}
  - {Action: Overlay metric callout "63% feel behind" with animated percentage counter.}

## Segment 3 – DC43 Breakthrough (1:05–2:05)
- **Narration**
  > "DC43 gives you composable building blocks. One microservice stores contracts in an open format, another orchestrates policy workflows, and adapters publish those contracts to Spark jobs, lakehouses, or whatever execution engine you prefer." 
  > "Because contracts are versioned and addressable, the governance team can approve once and let product teams reuse everywhere. Update a contract, and DC43 pushes a signed artifact to every downstream pipeline so you never have to chase change tickets again." 
  > "And the kicker? The entire stack is open source. You can wire DC43 into your own catalog, keep sensitive metadata in your environment, and still contribute improvements back to the community."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Reveal.js slide animates in modular blocks labeled "Contract Store", "Workflow Orchestrator", "Runtime Adapter".}
  - {Action: Highlight arrows showing reuse across Lakehouse, Streaming, ML nodes.}
  - {Action: Show GitHub repo URL as floating caption.}

## Segment 4 – Impact Vignette (2:05–2:45)
- **Narration**
  > "Here's a real pattern we see. A retail analytics squad needed to launch a back-to-school promotion. Before DC43, approvals took three weeks. With DC43 they cloned an existing contract, tweaked the policy for the new season, and the orchestrator pushed it live the same day. That reduced risk review time by 82% and unlocked new experimentation budget." 
  > "Imagine what your team could ship if contracts stopped being blockers and started being reusable product assets."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Show storyboard of a kanban board moving a card from "Governance Review" to "Approved" instantly.}
  - {Action: Overlay stat bubble "82% faster approvals".}

## Segment 5 – Call to Action (2:45–3:15)
- **Narration**
  > "Ready to feel that difference? Head to dc43.dev/quickstart or run `pip install dc43` right now. Drop a comment about the governance bottleneck you're fighting—we might feature your story in the next capsule." 
  > "And if you want to help shape the roadmap, join the community stand-up every Thursday. Links are in the description."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Bring up CTA slide with QR code placeholder, icons for GitHub, Discord, and Calendar.}
  - {Action: End on confident smile, point to QR code, fade out with upbeat music sting.}

## Safety & Compliance Notes
- Keep metrics labeled as internal survey insights or anonymized case studies.
- Remind viewers the platform is modular and open source—encourage forks, not proprietary lock-in claims.
