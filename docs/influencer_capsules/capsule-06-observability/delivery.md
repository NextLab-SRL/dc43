# Delivery Guide â€“ Capsule 06

## Tone & Pace
- Energetic and reassuring. You're the guide who helps teams stay ahead of
  issues.
- Cadence: 165 wpm; slow to 150 wpm when introducing commands or alert steps.

## Body Language
- Gesture upward when saying "surface metrics" and downward when saying
  "trigger alerts" to reinforce directionality.
- Nod when referencing quick wins to build trust.

## Visual Tips
- Keep Grafana B-roll running behind you using a subtle blur.
- Place Slack notification mock on left side so it doesn't block captions.

## CTA Emphasis
- Mention the observability office hours and community forum explicitly.
- Encourage viewers to comment with their favorite panel idea.

## Post-Production
- Apply teal glow effect to highlight metrics on screen.
- Layer subtle motion graphic pulses on the sonar icon of the intro slide.
- Add captions with Aqua (#47D1C1) keywords to emphasize important terms.
