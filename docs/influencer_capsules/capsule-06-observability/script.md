# Capsule 06 – Observability Playbook for DC43

**Runtime target:** 3 minutes 40 seconds (LinkedIn + YouTube)

## Segment 1 – Hook (0:00–0:20)
- **Narration**
  > "You can't improve what you can't see. Today I'm walking through the DC43 observability playbook—dashboards, alerts, and automations you can deploy in under an hour."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Start with animated dashboard flyover, cut to host.}
  - {Action: Pop-up text "Observability Playbook" with sonar pulse effect.}

## Segment 2 – Problem Statement (0:20–0:55)
- **Narration**
  > "Governance tools often stop at approvals. Once the contract is live, teams are blind to drift, SLA breaches, or failed policy checks." 
  > "DC43 emits rich metrics so you can treat governance as a living service, not a static document."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Show slide with red alert icons fading into DC43 metrics panel.}

## Segment 3 – Playbook Overview (0:55–1:45)
- **Narration**
  > "Our playbook has three layers. One: instrumentation—agents emit metrics to Prometheus. Two: dashboards—Grafana boards highlight contract health, freshness, and policy breaches. Three: automation—webhooks trigger Slack or Teams alerts when thresholds are crossed." 
  > "You can deploy this stack locally using the docker compose file in the repo."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Walk through layered diagram slide.}
  - {Action: Highlight each layer as it's mentioned.}

## Segment 4 – Demo (1:45–3:05)
- **Narration**
  > "Let's spin it up. We'll run `docker compose -f deploy/compose/observability-demo.yml up` to start Prometheus and Grafana. Then we launch the DC43 streaming agent in demo mode so it emits metrics." 
  > "Watch the dashboard light up with contract counts, SLA adherence, and policy status. When I intentionally break freshness, the alert fires to Slack within seconds." 
  > "All of this uses synthetic data—you can replicate it safely." 
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Screen record terminal + Grafana dashboard.}
  - {Action: Trigger alert by pausing data feed; show Slack notification mock.}

## Segment 5 – CTA (3:05–3:40)
- **Narration**
  > "Download the observability playbook and make it your own. Share your favorite panel layout in the community forum—we'll feature the best ones." 
  > "Next week I'll show how to extend these alerts into automated remediation."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: CTA slide with download link, Slack channel, QR.}
  - {Action: End with confident nod, fade out on dashboard loop.}

## Safety Notes
- Use mock Slack workspace names and anonymized data.
- Encourage viewers to adjust alert thresholds before deploying to production.
