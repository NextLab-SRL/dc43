# Capsule 03 – Governance Blueprint for Modern Data Contracts

**Runtime target:** 3 minutes 30 seconds (LinkedIn primary)

## Segment 1 – Hook (0:00–0:18)
- **Narration**
  > "Governance isn't paperwork—it's product design. Let me walk you through a DC43 blueprint that gets compliance, engineering, and product teams on the same whiteboard in under an hour."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Start beside digital whiteboard with blueprint overlay.}
  - {Action: Animate headline "Governance = Product" sliding in.}

## Segment 2 – The Alignment Gap (0:18–0:60)
- **Narration**
  > "In most organizations, governance teams live in catalog tools, engineers live in Git, and the product team just wants to ship. Contracts live everywhere and nowhere, so approvals drag on." 
  > "DC43 treats governance like an API. Everyone plugs into the same contract definition, with workflows that mirror how teams already build software."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Display Venn diagram showing Governance, Engineering, Product with question mark in the middle.}
  - {Action: Swap question mark for DC43 logo as you finish the line.}

## Segment 3 – Blueprint Overview (0:60–1:50)
- **Narration**
  > "Here's the playbook we use with clients. Step one: run a 45-minute discovery with each stakeholder group. We document pain points using the DC43 Maturity Radar template." 
  > "Step two: map critical data products to contract bundles. Each bundle links policies, data quality thresholds, and owners." 
  > "Step three: configure DC43 workflows—intake forms, review gates, and automated notifications. Because it's all YAML, you can version it in Git alongside your code."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Walk through slide showing the three-step flow.}
  - {Action: Zoom into the Maturity Radar visual.}
  - {Action: Highlight YAML snippet tying owners to policy gates.}

## Segment 4 – Case Study (1:50–2:50)
- **Narration**
  > "A global bank used this blueprint to unify 12 governance processes. They created a DC43 contract bundle for every critical domain, wired approvals into Microsoft Teams, and let engineering automate attestations. Result: 40% faster policy sign-offs and fewer audit findings." 
  > "Governance became part of their delivery rhythm instead of a gate at the end."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Overlay map with highlighted regions and stat bubble "40% faster sign-offs".}
  - {Action: B-roll of Teams approval notification.}

## Segment 5 – CTA (2:50–3:30)
- **Narration**
  > "You can download the entire blueprint, including workshop agendas and templates, in the link below." 
  > "Drop a comment with the toughest governance meeting you've ever sat through—I'll share how DC43 turns that into a 30-minute working session." 
  > "Next capsule, we'll dig into how to co-design policies with your data catalog team."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Present CTA slide with blueprint checklist and QR.}
  - {Action: Gesture to whiteboard template preview.}
