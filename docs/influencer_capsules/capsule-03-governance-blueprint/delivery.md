# Delivery Guide – Capsule 03

## Presence
- Present like a facilitator leading a workshop—warm, encouraging, inclusive.
- Maintain steady eye contact and nod subtly when referencing stakeholder wins.

## Gestures
- Use open-handed gestures when mentioning collaboration.
- Point to whiteboard sections as you describe each step of the blueprint.

## Cadence
- 160 wpm average. Slow down to 140 wpm when quoting statistics.
- Insert a 1-second pause between each step in Segment 3 to emphasize clarity.

## Visual Direction
- Overlay blueprint schematics in teal line art on dark background.
- For the case study, animate numbers counting up to highlight improvement.

## CTA Execution
- Show the downloadable blueprint on a tablet or virtual mockup while you call
  out the resources.
- End with a verbal reminder that templates are customizable and open source.

## Post-Production Tips
- Color-grade to emphasize teal and coral brand accents.
- Add gentle whoosh transitions between slides to mimic blueprint drafting.
- Include captions at bottom third with alternating background colors for
  readability.
