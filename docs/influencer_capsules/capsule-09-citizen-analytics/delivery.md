# Delivery Guide â€“ Capsule 09

## Tone
- Empowering, inclusive, and a bit celebratory. You're cheering for analysts
  while assuring governance leaders everything stays compliant.

## Pace
- 165 wpm baseline. Slow to 145 wpm when listing steps in the empowerment flow.

## Gestures
- Use "open door" hand motion when talking about access requests.
- Point toward imaginary dashboard when describing final output.

## Visual Direction
- Overlay confetti burst when showing completed dashboard (subtle, 1s).
- Keep compliance badge visible during demo to reinforce guardrails.

## CTA Execution
- Invite viewers to comment with the dashboard they plan to build first.
- Mention the community newsletter highlight to encourage sharing.

## Post-Production
- Add gentle bokeh background to keep focus on host.
- Color-code captions: Aqua for action verbs, Coral for governance notes.
- Use quick zoom transitions when moving between portal, notebook, and dashboard
  to maintain energy.
