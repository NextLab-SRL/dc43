# Capsule 09 – Citizen Analytics without Chaos

**Runtime target:** 3 minutes 10 seconds (LinkedIn, internal enablement)

## Segment 1 – Hook (0:00–0:20)
- **Narration**
  > "Citizen analysts are building dashboards faster than governance can keep up. Let's see how DC43 gives them freedom with guardrails—no endless approvals required."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Start with split screen: excited analyst vs. overwhelmed governance.}
  - {Action: Overlay text "Freedom + Guardrails".}

## Segment 2 – Current Pain (0:20–0:55)
- **Narration**
  > "Self-service programs fail when analysts copy-paste data into spreadsheets, forget lineage, or bypass policies." 
  > "DC43 bundles contracts, glossary definitions, and approved queries so analysts can plug into governed datasets safely."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Show chaotic spreadsheet montage morphing into clean DC43 portal.}

## Segment 3 – Empowerment Flow (0:55–1:45)
- **Narration**
  > "Here's the flow. Analysts pick a certified contract from the DC43 portal, request access via a one-click workflow, and receive a ready-to-use notebook with embedded policies." 
  > "DC43 tracks who used which contract, surfaces recommended visualizations, and enforces row-level security automatically." 
  > "All approvals happen asynchronously; no standing meetings required."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Walk through slide showing three-step flow.}
  - {Action: Highlight asynchronous approvals.}

## Segment 4 – Demo (1:45–2:40)
- **Narration**
  > "I'll run the citizen analytics starter kit. Watch me request access to the retail insights contract, receive a notebook preloaded with safe queries, and publish a dashboard." 
  > "DC43 logs the entire journey—perfect for audits—and governance can revoke access if policies change." 
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Screen capture portal, request flow, and notebook execution.}
  - {Action: Show dashboard embed with compliance badge.}

## Segment 5 – CTA (2:40–3:10)
- **Narration**
  > "Download the starter kit for your citizen program. Customize the notebook template, share the glossary cards, and invite analysts to experiment within guardrails." 
  > "Tell us what dashboards you build—we'll highlight them in the community newsletter."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: CTA slide with starter kit link, QR, and Slack channel.}
  - {Action: End with friendly wave.}

## Safety Notes
- Reinforce that all demo data is synthetic.
- Encourage viewers to implement role-based access control in their own
  environment before enabling production workloads.
