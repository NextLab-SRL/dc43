# Delivery Guide – Capsule 04

## Tone
- Enthusiastic but transparent. Emphasize roadmap status repeatedly.
- Position yourself as a collaborator inviting feedback, not an announcer of a
  finished feature.

## On-Camera Tips
- Keep "Prototype" badge visible in the lower third throughout.
- Use pointing gestures when discussing contribution steps to reinforce action.

## Script Handling
- Teleprompter speed: 165 wpm, but slow to 140 wpm for disclaimer lines.
- Highlight {Action: …} cues in editor timeline to align overlays.

## CTA Delivery
- Mention the working group cadence and Slack/Discord channel verbally.
- Encourage viewers to DM questions about security reviews or policy mapping.

## Post-Production
- Add animated dotted lines between DC43 and Snowflake icons in the architecture
  slide.
- Use teal (#47D1C1) accent lighting to match brand.
- Subtitle all disclaimers in bold coral (#FF6F61).
