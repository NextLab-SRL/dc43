# Delivery Guide â€“ Capsule 05

## Performance Notes
- Adopt an expert-but-approachable tone. Think solutions architect walking a
  team through an exciting upgrade.
- When explaining demos, smile slightly and glance toward the screen capture to
  direct viewer attention.

## Gestures
- Use hands to trace table layers when mentioning lakehouse architecture.
- Hold up five fingers when outlining the four demo steps, lowering them as you
  count down.

## Teleprompter
- Speed: 170 wpm baseline; slow to 150 wpm while quoting commands.
- Insert 0.5 second pause before each major action to sync with screen capture.

## Visual Enhancements
- Overlay animated particles resembling data points during architecture slide.
- Use wipe transition when switching from contract YAML to notebook view.

## CTA
- Mention the resource pack twice: once mid-demo, once in final CTA.
- Encourage viewers to tag #DC43Builds so the community team can reshare.

## Post-Production
- Add lower-third callouts for key metrics (freshness 15m, completeness 99.9%).
- Use brand subtitles: white text on semi-transparent midnight blue bar.
