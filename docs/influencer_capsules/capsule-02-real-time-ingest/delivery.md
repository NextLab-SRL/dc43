# Delivery Guide – Capsule 02

## Vocal Direction
- Speak with a confident, instructive tone. Use upward inflection when naming
  commands and downward inflection on benefits to signal certainty.
- Insert micro-pauses after each step in the demo to let on-screen actions
  register.

## Visual Rhythm
- Alternate between host camera and screen capture every 10–12 seconds to keep
  energy high.
- When reading YAML, zoom into the code block and highlight rows with a laser
  pointer effect.

## Gesture Notes
- Use right hand to trace the architecture blocks on the slide.
- When describing the tokenization workflow, mimic a "masking" motion by moving
  palm horizontally across the frame.

## CTA Coaching
- Mention the hashtag #DC43Builds verbally and on-screen.
- Invite viewers to share their favorite streaming tool so you can reference it
  in a future capsule.

## Post-Production
- Layer subtle glitch transitions when cutting from legacy pain to DC43 solution.
- Add HUD-style overlays showing throughput numbers (use synthetic values in
  resources file).
- Caption the entire video; highlight command names in Aqua (#47D1C1).
