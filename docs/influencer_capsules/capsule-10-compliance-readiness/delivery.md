# Delivery Guide â€“ Capsule 10

## Tone
- Calm, authoritative, reassuring. Speak like a compliance lead who has seen
  every audit scenario and has it under control.

## Pace
- 155 wpm average. Slow to 135 wpm when detailing the command sequence.

## Gestures
- Use steady hand motions to signal organization (e.g., stacking papers).
- Point to checklist items as you reference them to emphasize clarity.

## Visual Direction
- Overlay subtle ticking clock animation at intro, fade out by Segment 2.
- Highlight key checklist rows with glowing underline in post.

## CTA Execution
- Encourage viewers to run the evidence command in a sandbox immediately.
- Mention the compliance working group cadence (monthly) and invite sign-ups.

## Post-Production
- Add low-tempo percussion bed (90 BPM) mixed quietly for gravitas.
- Use teal and coral accent bars to separate sections in captions.
- Include on-screen text "Synthetic data" when showing bundle contents.
