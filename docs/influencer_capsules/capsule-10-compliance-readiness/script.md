# Capsule 10 – Compliance Readiness with DC43

**Runtime target:** 3 minutes 30 seconds (LinkedIn + compliance webinars)

## Segment 1 – Hook (0:00–0:20)
- **Narration**
  > "Audit season shouldn't feel like a fire drill. Let me show you how DC43 keeps your contracts audit-ready with evidence trails, policy attestations, and automated controls."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Start with ticking clock SFX, cut to calm host.}
  - {Action: Overlay text "Audit-ready by design".}

## Segment 2 – Pain (0:20–0:55)
- **Narration**
  > "Most compliance teams chase screenshots, email approvals, and stale spreadsheets. It's impossible to prove who changed what and when." 
  > "DC43 version-controls every contract, stores approvals as signed manifests, and generates evidence bundles automatically."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Display collage of messy evidence files transitioning to organized dashboard.}

## Segment 3 – Control Framework (0:55–1:50)
- **Narration**
  > "We map DC43 capabilities to standard control frameworks—SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR. The compliance readiness checklist covers control ownership, automation coverage, and manual review cadence." 
  > "Every time a contract is approved, DC43 logs an immutable record with reviewers, timestamps, and policy diffs." 
  > "Need quarterly attestation? Trigger the workflow template and DC43 emails stakeholders automatically."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Walk through checklist slide highlighting each control column.}
  - {Action: Zoom into manifest JSON showing signatures.}

## Segment 4 – Demo (1:50–2:50)
- **Narration**
  > "I'll export an evidence bundle right now. Using the CLI, we run `dc43 compliance bundle retail-promos --quarter Q3-2024`. The command compiles contracts, manifests, policy diffs, and monitoring logs into a single zip." 
  > "We upload it to our GRC system and mark the control as satisfied. No last-minute scramble." 
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: Screen capture CLI command + resulting folder.}
  - {Action: Show zipped bundle contents with highlights.}

## Segment 5 – CTA (2:50–3:30)
- **Narration**
  > "Download the compliance readiness checklist, run the evidence bundle command in your sandbox, and share feedback with our compliance working group." 
  > "DC43 is built for transparency—let's make your next audit boring."
- **Stage directions**
  - {Action: CTA slide with checklist link, working group QR, and contact info.}
  - {Action: End with confident smile and close laptop to signal completion.}

## Safety Notes

  for regulated environments.
