# dc43-contracts-app changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Dedicated data product catalog view and navigation entry surfacing ODPS artifacts alongside
  existing contracts and datasets.
- Documented contract status guardrails in the integration helper stub and notes so generated Spark
  snippets explain how to opt into draft or deprecated contracts safely.
